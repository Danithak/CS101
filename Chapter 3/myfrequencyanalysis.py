# Crypto Analysis: Frequency Analysis
#
# Note: This solution did not pass by the interpreter, but the output matches that listed
# by the test cases.

# To analyze encrypted messages, to find out information about the possible 
# algorithm or even language of the clear text message, one could perform 
# frequency analysis. This process could be described as simply counting 
# the number of times a certain symbol occurs in the given text. 
# For example:
# For the text "test" the frequency of 'e' is 1, 's' is 1 and 't' is 2.
#
# The input to the function will be an encrypted body of text that only contains 
# the lowercase letters a-z. 
# As output you should return a list of the normalized frequency 
# for each of the letters a-z. 
# The normalized frequency is simply the number of occurrences, i, 
# divided by the total number of characters in the message, n.

def freq_analysis(message): 		
	divisor = 1 / float(len(message)) # Determines the appropriate value for one occurrence of a letter.
	check_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p','q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
	freq_list = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
	for i in message:
		pos = check_list.index(i)
		freq_list[pos] += divisor 	# Adds the appropriate frequency percentage to the 
	return freq_list				# corresponding letter.
